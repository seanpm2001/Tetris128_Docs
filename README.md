## General description

Tetris128 is an advanced, open source Tetris variant, which goes far beyond the normal scope of a Tetris game. Support for non tetrominoes is available, ranging from dominos to decominoes, and also support for "party mix" mode, which combines various minoes into one. It also has a Tetris printer (digital art) mode, and support for softbody physics. It is 128 bit software and is written in Python and GDScript.
